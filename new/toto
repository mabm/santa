// From the release notes:

//  Because many of our users are uncomfortable receiving undelegated answers

//  from root or top level domains, other than a few for whom that behaviour

//  has been trusted and expected for quite some length of time, we have now

//  introduced the "root-delegations-only" feature which applies delegation-only

//  logic to all top level domains, and to the root domain.  An exception list

//  should be specified, including "MUSEUM" and "DE", and any other top level

//  domains from whom undelegated responses are expected and trusted.

// root-delegation-only exclude { "DE"; "MUSEUM"; };
